---- This is my first application, so please cut me some slack ----

This is a Vanilla JS application I built to learn more complex DOM manipulation.  The original thought was to have it do live updates during the games; however, I was not able to find a free API to provide the data.  I also don't have the ability to use Node, as I am on a work laptop since Windows 10 killed my personal.  In saying so, I had to use a couple work-arounds for the project in order to have it work.

Next steps (in no particular order):
  - Upload to GitHub / start using Git
  - Learn ES6 modules to reduce overall code using import/export
  - Learn internalStorage
  - Buy a laptop so I can learn Node :)
